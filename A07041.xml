            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHo then! And boyes will now be a Pi≈øtle-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, either without their fathers leaue, or their elder brothers adui≈øe, we ≈øhall haue our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Art brought to a prettie pa≈ø≈øe within a while, I could a told tis long agoe, that my father would get him ≈øo many ≈øons, as Iohn Canturbury woulde haue no cau≈øe to ≈øitte quiet at dinner or ≈øupper, for looking to his young nephewes. I thought boyes would be a doing. But, fooli≈øh ≈øtripling, can≈øt thou tell what thou ha≈øt done? I weene not, if my father ≈øhould be hurt, either at the Groine, or at the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbes of Lisbone, is this the way either to cure him, or to comforte him, to publi≈øhe his ≈øcrabled and weather-beaten papers in this forte? What if hee hadde in purpo≈øe to write no more, ≈øeeing the daunger and trouble that comes of it? Will this be any meanes to worke the olde mans quietnes, for a fooli≈øh and a headie ≈øpringal, to go ≈øet abroad his papers? Thou ≈øawe≈øt wel enough, that Martins doings were now almo≈øt forgot &amp; hui≈øht. And the<note n="a" place="margin">Beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, Reader, that I giue my Lordes their right titles.</note> men of ≈øinne them≈øelues, I meane the Cantur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burie Caiphas, with the re≈øt of his Antichri≈øtian bea≈øts, who beare his abominable marke, were content in a maner to turne his purpo≈øes from a ≈øerious matter, to a point of je≈øting, wherewith they would haue onely rimers and ≈øtage-players (that is, plaine rogues, as thou ha≈øt well noted) to
<pb facs="tcp:12606:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>deale. So that had not thy vntimely folly bewray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ≈øelfe, it may be, that the ≈øyllogi≈ømes whereby our father hath crackt the crowne of Canturbury, ≈øhould haue had no other an≈øwere, or he him≈øelfe none other puni≈øhment but this. I faith lette him go, Martin is a madde knaue. Whereas now vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this ≈øcrabbling and paltring of thine, marke whether Iohn Canturburie will not ≈øende for all the knaue pur≈øuvants that belongs vnto his pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and ≈øet them a worke with the confutation of Martin, v≈øing ≈øome ≈øuch ≈øpeach as this is, in the direction of them, for the choice of their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments again≈øt him.</p>

What thinke you? Haue you beene carefull of vs and our places, to ≈øinde vs out the pre≈ø≈øe and letters, wherewith the≈øe ≈øeditious Martins are printed? Or, haue you diligently ≈øoght mee out Walde-graue the Printer, Newman the Cobler, Sharpe the booke binder of Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and that ≈øeditious Welch man Penry, who you ≈øhall ≈øee will prooue the Author of all the≈øe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belles? I thanke you Mai≈øter Munday, you are a good Gentleman of your worde.

And nowe thou ≈øee≈øt we are as farre to ≈øeeke for them, as euer we were. Nay, vnle≈ø≈øe we haue
<pb facs="tcp:12606:3"/>them now, they are like to trouble<note n="a" place="margin">But not the church of Chri≈øt good vncle: you doe not ≈øo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eare though they did.</note> our Churche more then euer they did. For here is a yong Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin hatched out of ≈øome poy≈øoned egge of that ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious libeller, Old Martin. Why truly it grieues me, at the heart, that I, by her Maie≈øties fauor, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing more authoritie in mine hande to repre≈ø≈øe the≈øe Puritanes, then any bi≈øhop el≈øe hath had in England the≈øe thirtie yeeres, yet ≈øhoulde be more troubled and mole≈øted by them the≈øe ≈øixe yeeres, then all my predece≈ø≈øors haue beene the≈øe ≈øix and twentie yeeres. And all this commeth by rea≈øon of your vnfaithfulnes and negligence, whome wee ≈øend for them. Well, I giue you warning, looke better vnto your offices, or el≈øe let mee be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned body and ≈øoule,<note n="b" place="margin">Neuer conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter man, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, thou arte ≈øure of that alreadie.</note> if I turne you not all out of your places. Therefore looke to it: for nowe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of you ≈øhal haue warrants, both for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe, and as many as you will ≈øub≈øtitute vnder you be≈øides. Bring vs whome≈øoeuer you ≈øu≈øpect, your warrants ≈øhall ≈øerue you to doe it. And if you can ≈øinde vs eyther young or olde Martin, Penry, or Walde-graue, ≈øo that you bring the pre≈ø≈øe and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, hee ≈øhall haue fortie poundes for his labour, who ≈øo euer will bring them, his charges and all bonie cleare. But if you bring vs neither Martin, the pre≈ø≈øe, nor tho≈øe aforenamed, neuer looke vs in the face more. And me thinkes for your owne good, you ≈øhoulde be carefull to get in the≈øe ≈øediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men: for if we that are Lordes of the Cleargie go downe once, then ≈øhall you be ≈øure to fall: for, poore men, you haue nothing but what you get in<note n="c" place="margin">And you haue nothing neither your ≈øelues, but what you get in the ≈øeruice of your Lorde and Ma≈øter the diuel.</note> our ≈øeruice that are your Lordes and Mai≈øters. And me thinkes, if the≈øe wayward men had anie con≈øcience in them, they woulde not ≈øeeke our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowe

            <p>Well, if euer you meane to do anie good in this matter, take mee this cour≈øe, which wee here in commi≈ø≈øion haue thought meete≈øt; let a ≈øix or ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of you, or your ≈øub≈øtitutes that ≈øtay heere in London, watch mee Paules Churchyard, e≈øpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally haue an eie to Boyles ≈øhop at the Ro≈øe. And let ≈øome one or two of you that are vnknowen goe in thither, and if there be any ≈øtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>gers in the ≈øhop, fall in talke with them of Martin, commend him, and e≈øpecially his ≈øonnes la≈øt libell, (and heere, hee that will take that cour≈øe, take me this, that if need be you may ≈øhew it) ≈øhewing, that by great friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhippe you gote one of them, ≈øaying al≈øo, that you vnder≈øtoode a man might there helpe his friend to ≈øome, if he were acquainted with Ma≈øter Boyle, and offer largely for it. Now ≈øir, if any ≈øhall either enter with you vnto any ≈øpeches again≈øt the ≈øtate, and in defence of the≈øe libelles: or el≈øe, if any can procure you to the ≈øight of the bookes, be ≈øure to bring them before vs. Though you learne not their names, yet your warrants ≈øhall ≈øerue your turnes, in as much as you doe ≈øu≈øpect them. And thus I would haue ≈øome of you be≈øtowed.</p>
            <p>Let three or foure more of you or your ≈øub≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes be euery day at the Blacke Friers, Lincolnes inne, White-chappell, Paules chaine, as often as Charke, Gardiner, Egerton, or Cooper do preach.

E≈øpecially marke if you ≈øee any before the ≈øermon beginnes, ≈øetting their heads together, and whi≈øpering vnder their cloakes, if you doe, be ≈øure they are reading Martin, and haue them foorthwith to the pri≈øon vntill we ≈øend for them, or cau≈øe them to putte in ≈øufficient ≈øureties, to appeare the next court day.</p>
            <p>You that ≈øtay here in London, mu≈øt al≈øo be ≈øure, if po≈ø≈øibly you can, to haue a watch at al common innes, to ≈øee what carriage of paper, and other ≈øtuffe, either goes from, or commes to London. Thereby you may happely learne ≈øomething. And marke if any Puritane receiueth any thing, open his packe, that you may be ≈øure hee hath no Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins ≈øent him. We will direct our warrants ≈øo, that you may ≈øearch all packes<note n="a" place="margin">I hope the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuvants in time ≈øhall be able to make a good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, in taking toll of tho≈øe packes which they do not open</note> at your di≈øcretion. We will take order al≈øo, that the Court may be watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed who di≈øper≈øe, or reade the≈øe libelles there. And in faith I thinke they doe my Lord of E≈ø≈øex greate wrong, that ≈øay, he fauours Martin: I do not think he will be ≈øo vnwi≈øe, as to fauour the≈øe, who are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies vnto the ≈øtate. For if hee doe, her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtie, I can tell him, will withdraw her gratious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour from him; but take you no care for the court. Watch you London, and learne mee where New-man and Walde-graues haunt is, and there be ≈øure to watch earely and late. Haue an eie al≈øo vnto all the Puritanes hou≈øes in London, e≈øpecially my L.

            <p>As for you that goe into the countrey, I woulde haue ye e≈øpecialy go into Northampton and War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke

Others mu≈øt goe into E≈ø≈øex, Suffolke, and Norffolke. And if you can bring vs no Martini≈øts from thence (at the lea≈øt, that by that meanes your charges may be borne, I would ye might ≈øtarue for me.) There is Moore, there is Aline, there is Knew≈øtub, there is Wright, with many others, all very ≈øeditious men, that is pitty by my troth, that ≈øo many wor≈øhipfull and good nurtured knights and gentlemen, are carried away with them, and their way wardnes, as in tho≈øe partes are ≈øeduced.

            <p>Loe, ≈øir boy, haue you not ≈øpunne a faire threed, for our fathers ea≈øe and quietne≈ø≈øe, and for the quietne≈ø≈øe of your brethren?

            <p>It may be thou wilt ≈øay, that thy father is euerie day in the weeke able to make as many men of his owne charges; I woulde he were el≈øe: if hee be, it is more then I knowe, I promi≈øe thee, and I thinke more then thou can≈øt prooue.

            <p>As for my ≈øelfe, to omitte the honourable men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that my father (my father, I ≈øaie, <hi>Quem honoris cau≈øa nomino, quoties nomino, nomino autem ≈øaepi≈ø≈øime</hi>) made of me in his writings, whereas hee did not once vouch≈øafe to ≈øpeake a worde of ≈øuch a dilling as thou art, <hi>I</hi> ≈øhould haue thought, that the verie name of an elder brother ≈øhold haue taught thee, that there had beene one in the world, to whome by right of inheritance, the Pi≈øtling of bi≈øhops had belonged, after the decea≈øe of reuerend Martin him≈øelfe.

And this thou knowe≈øt he mu≈øt do, vnle≈ø≈øe his wi≈øedom hath before hand preuented the inconuenience. <hi>I</hi> deny not in deede, but it is ea≈øier for him to alter his cour≈øe, then for any one writer that <hi>I</hi> knowe of, becau≈øe hee hath cho≈øen him ≈øuch a methode as no man el≈øe be≈øides hath done.

For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed thine vncle Cantur. is no le≈ø≈øe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> a mo≈øt vile and cur≈ø≈øed tyrant in the Church.

            <p>I Martin Senior Gentleman, ≈øonne and heire to the reuerende and woorthie Metropolitane Martin Mar-prelate the Great, doe prote≈øt, affirme, ≈øay, propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d, and object again≈øt Iohn Canturburie and his brethren, in maner and forme following;</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt I prote≈øt and affirme, that the fore≈øaide Iohn Whitgift, <hi>alias</hi> Canturburie, which nameth
<pb facs="tcp:12606:8"/>him≈øelfe archbi≈øhop of Canturburie, is no Mini≈øter at all in the church of God, but hath, and doeth wrongfully v≈øurp, and inuade the name and ≈øeate of the mini≈øterie, vnto the great detriment of the Church of God, the vtter ≈øpoyle of the ≈øoules of men, &amp; the likelie ruine of this common-wealth, together with the great di≈øhonour of her Maje≈øtie and the ≈øtate. And in this ca≈øe do I affirme al the Lord bi≈øhops in England to be.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Item I do prote≈øt, that the entering in of this cur≈ø≈øed man Iohn Whitgift, and of all others our bi≈øhoppes in Englande, is not an entring into the church of God by the doore Chri≈øt Ie≈øus. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I affirme all of them to be theeues, robbers, wolues, and worriers of the flocke, and therefore no true ≈øhepeheards.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Item I do proclame the ≈øaide Iohn Cantur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burie, with the re≈øt of our Prelates, to bee common ≈øimoniarkes, ≈øuch as make merchandize of church liuings and benefices, by faculties, di≈øpen≈øations, &amp;c. and make as common a gaine of Church cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures, by ab≈øolutions &amp; commutations of pena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce, &amp;c. as anie men in the lande doe of their lawefull trades and occupations.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Item I do propound and affirme, that the ≈øaid Iohn Canturburie and his brethren, do hinder and lette with all their might, the true knowledge of God amonge≈øt her Maje≈øties louing ≈øubjectes, the inhabitants of this kingdome, and thereby, be≈øides their owne fore-prouided damnation, are guiltie of the blood of infinite thou≈øands.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Item I doe proclaime, that the ≈øaide Iohn Whitgift with the re≈øt of his brethren, doth ≈øpend and wa≈øte the patrimonie of the Church (which

            <p n="6">6 Item I doe propound, that the ≈øaid Ioh.

            <p n="7">7 Item I the ≈øaide Martin Senior, do prote≈øt and affirme the ≈øaide Iohn Whitgift, with the re≈øt of his brethren, to haue incurred the ≈øtatute of <hi>premunire facies,</hi> for depriuing of Mini≈øters, for not ≈øub≈øcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, not wearing the ≈øurpli≈øe, and for other their manifolde proceedings again≈øt law and equitie.</p>

            <p>Item I do prote≈øt &amp; affirme that the true chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che of God ought to haue no more to do with Io.

            <p>Item particularly, concerning Iohn Canturbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie him≈øelfe, I doe affirme, but yet no further then <hi>quatenus probabile,</hi> that is, by great likelihoodes, that he is ≈øo finally hardened in his hainous ≈øinnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt God and his church, that as hee cannot be reclaimed, for his mouth is full of cur≈øing again≈øt God and his Saintes, his feete are ≈øwift to ≈øhed the blood of the holie ones, hee teareth in peeces the churches which hee ought to fo≈øter, wilfully pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the ≈øhepheards from their ≈øheepe, and ≈øo ≈øcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering them in a mo≈øt lamentable ≈øorte, making much of wicked men that mainteine his pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and ≈ømiting the righteous for gaine≈øaying his wayes, bringing in daily into the church, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by him≈øelfe or his hang Ions newe errors not

And being rooted in mallice again≈øt that truth of Chri≈øt Ie≈øus (who is ble≈ø≈øed for euer) which he may ≈øee, if he did not hood-winke him≈øelfe, hee with all his power contrarieth and ≈øtriueth again≈øt the going forwarde of the Go≈øpell, lea≈øt by the light thereof his ≈øinnes ≈øhoulde be reprooued. Finally, hee hath in him too too many likelie te≈øtimonies of an heire of the kingdome of darkene≈ø≈øe, where, without his true turning vnto the Lorde, hee ≈øhall liue in hell for euer.</p>
            <p>And wicked man! if thou meane≈øt to bee el≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where receiued, that is, into Chri≈øtes kingdome, turne thee from thy wickednes, and let men and Angelles be witne≈ø≈øes of thy conuer≈øion.

And I woulde not wi≈øhe thee to deferre thy repentance, lea≈øt thou calle≈øt with the fooli≈øh virgins when there is no opening. Thou ≈øee≈øt euen heere vpon earth manife≈øt tokens of Gods anger towards thee.

There are almo≈øt none of Gods children, but had as lieue ≈øee a ≈øerpent, as meete thee, not becau≈øe they feare thy face, but in as much as it greeueth them, that their eyes are forced to looke vpon ≈øo wicked an enemie of God and his church. Thine owne creatures them ≈øelues honour thee, but as tyrants are commonlie honoured of their para≈øites and ≈øycophants. Thy brother the pope
<pb facs="tcp:12606:10"/>hath the like honor vnto thine, that is, an honor who≈øe end will be ≈øhame and confu≈øion of face for euer. The fearefull and contemptible ende, that haue beene brought vppon many of them, ought to terrifie thee. Nay, the me≈ø≈øage of death which the Lord ≈øent lately euen into thine owne hou≈øe, ought to mooue thee, and force thee to confe≈ø≈øe, that thy yeares al≈øo, yea, and dayes are nombred. Doctor Perne, thou knowe≈øt was thy joy, and thou his darling.

Hee liued a per≈øecutour, an athei≈øt, an hypocrite, and a di≈ø≈øembler, whome the worlde poynted at, and he died, thou knowe≈øt, the death due vnto ≈øuch a life as he ledde; thou knowe≈øt hee died ≈øuddenly euen at thine owne palace of Lambehith, when, in thine owne judgement he was likelie, in regarde of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilie ≈øtrength, though not of age to out-liue thee. And take thou his death for a forewarning of thy de≈øtruction, except thou repent.</p>
            <p>And the≈øe, brother Martin, with ≈øuch like points, or ≈øome of tho≈øe po≈øitions, wherwith I could haue thwacked my vncles about the ≈øhoulders I weene, an I had beene in thy place.

               <hi>I</hi> Martin Senior, Gentleman, doe heere prote≈øt, affirme, propound, and defend, that if Iohn Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turburie will needs haue a foole in his hou≈øe, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a wooden dagger, and a cocke≈ø-combe, that
<pb facs="tcp:12606:11"/>none is ≈øo fitte for that place as his brother Iohn a Bridges Deane of Sarum. And that he viz. Iohn Bridges is by right to di≈øplace the other, with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> Lambeth now playes the a≈ø≈øe, and is him ≈øelfe to be after a ≈øolemne maner, according to the booke of ordayning bi≈øhoppes and prie≈øtes inue≈øted vnto that roome. Hauing for his officers and daily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants the≈øe gentlemen following. Fir≈øt and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt D. Robert Some for his confe≈ø≈øor, who al≈øo, when his mai≈øter Iohn Sarum hath no v≈øe of his ≈øeruice, may be at my Lordes graces commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to reade the <hi>≈øtarue-vs</hi> booke in his Chappell at Lambeth. Secondly, if he were not ≈øomething touched with the coinquinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> of the fle≈øh, <hi>I</hi> would appoint none but D. Vnderhill to be his Almoner. Thirdly, Bancroft, and drunken Grauate ≈øhould be the yeomen of his Cellar. Ander≈øon<note n="a" place="margin">This chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lein robbed the poore mens box at Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton played the Potters part in the morrice daunce, and begotte his maide with child in Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øter≈øhire: and the≈øe things hee did ≈øince he was fir≈øte Prie≈øt.</note> par≈øon of Stepney, ≈øhould make roome before him with his two hand ≈øtaffe, as he did once before the morrice daunce, at a market towne in the edge of Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham or Bedford ≈øhires, where he bare the Potters part. His two ≈øupporters alwayes to leade him by the armes, mu≈øt be ≈øir Lenard Wright, and ≈øir Tom Blan o Bedford, the one whereof al≈øo mu≈øt carrie his bable, and the other a looking gla≈ø≈øe for their Mai≈øter, to ≈øee whether his catercappe doth euety way reach ouer his eares, and ≈øo ≈øtand according to his calling. As for Mar-Martin, and Iohn Freg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuile, they <hi>alterius vicibus,</hi> ≈øhall be the groomes of his ≈øtoole. The re≈øt of his officers <hi>I</hi> referre to the di≈øcretion of my father, vnto who≈øe cen≈øure al≈øo <hi>I</hi> doe humbly ≈øubmit this conceit of mine. And it may be, <hi>I</hi> am bolde, to appoint the≈øe men their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, who happily are at my fathers direction, to
<pb facs="tcp:12606:11"/>giue their attendance, where hee hath appointed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> their places. But this Ile bide by, though my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øhoulde ≈øay nay, that Iohn Bridges de≈øerues to haue his place that weares the wooden dagger, the cocke≈øcombe, and the copper chaine at Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>behith. I≈øe abide by it, come what wil of the matter.</p>
            <p>The next thing that we are to con≈øider, brother Martin, is, a more ju≈øt reprehen≈øion of the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes, then that wherewith thou blame≈øt them. For thou finde≈øt fault with the Preachers onely, and that ju≈øtly, I confe≈ø≈øe, becau≈øe they are no more forward in ca≈øting off the≈øe our popes. But I ≈øay, that with more equitie thou mighte≈øt haue blamed both the gentlemen and people together, with the Mini≈øters, then the Mini≈øters alone. For the Mini≈øters, although they be faultie, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding thou can≈øt not denie, but the Gentlemen and people are as deepe in faulte as they are. And I woulde wi≈øh them both the one &amp; the other, to take this, or ≈øome ≈øuch cour≈øe, as I heere ≈øet downe, which al≈øo for a great parte of it, though not all, I ≈øawe in a Puritans hand, and ≈øo came by a coppie of it, thinking if <hi>I</hi> coulde haue heard of my father, to let him haue the v≈øe of my copy: but now you ≈øee I publi≈øh it my ≈øelfe. <hi>I</hi> would then haue al the Puritans in the land, both lordes, knights, gentlemen, mini≈øters, and people, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come joint ≈øuiters in one ≈øupplicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> vnto her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øtie, and the Lords of her honorable priuie coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øell in the≈øe petitions;</p>
            <p n="1">1 Fir≈øt, that there may be a redre≈ø≈øe of the great ignorance wherewith our whole land is ouergro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen by placing, able, and faithfull teachers ouer euery congregation as neere as may be.</p>

            <p>Nowe Iacke, what ≈øaye≈øt thou? I am ≈øure thou can≈øt not denie, but the≈øe petitions, in thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would be an ea≈øie ≈øute. I trowe ≈øo too, and I thinke, that now thou finde≈øt greater fault, or at

            <p>Here I knowe, that thou arte readie to enquire two points of mee for thine in≈øtruction; the one, how our Prelates can be prooued Antichri≈øtes by the church of England, the other, howe thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt come by tho≈øe bookes of my father before quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Well, thus <hi>I</hi> will brieflie aun≈øweare thee in both.</p>
            <p>For the fir≈øt, Mai≈øter Tindall in the Preface of his booke called, The Obedience of a Chri≈øtian man pag. 102. prooueth them to bee Antichri≈øtes, in as much as in their doctrine, and their dooings, concerning nonre≈øidencie, they are directlie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt Chri≈øt and his worde. I charge thee reade the place, becau≈øe at this time I am not at lei≈øure
<pb facs="tcp:12606:14"/>to ≈øet it downe; I can tell thee the reading of it wil be double woorth thy paines.</p>
            <p>My fathers bookes afore ≈øpoken of, are not in print, <hi>I</hi> confe≈ø≈øe, I would they were. Yet it may be I could direct thee where to go, to haue mine. But bicau≈øe I meane yet further to puni≈øh thee for thy ≈ølippes in thy Pi≈øtle, I will not doe thee that plea ≈øure. For now in deede it commeth into my mind, that thou ha≈øt dealt fooli≈øhlie in two points, be≈øide all other thy fore-reckoned ouer≈øights.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt thou ha≈øt hereby exa≈øperated again≈øt thy father and other poore men his well willers, not onely thy vncle Caiphas, but ha≈øt ≈øet on the mo≈øt of thine neames, to giue their adui≈øe howe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap him and his fauourers. For tenne to one, but that Beelzebub of London will di≈øcharge the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuvants, to go to their bu≈øines with this or the like madmonition.</p>
            <p>My Ma≈øters, you mu≈øt not ≈øleepe in this matter.

And by the ma≈ø≈øe I will be a pur≈øuvant my ≈øelfe, rather then abide this tumult. And if I were, I trowe I would watch about Trauer≈øe his hou≈øe in Milke ≈øtreete, who go in and out there, and I would know what they ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried vnder their cloakes too, euen anie of them al. There is Paget at Houn≈ølo, I be≈øhrewe my heart if I would ≈øhewe him anie ≈øuch fauour as my Lordes Grace heere doeth. They are naught, they are naught, all the packe of them, Ile tru≈øt none of them all. There is Cartwright too at Warwicke, he hath got him ≈øuch a companie of di≈øciples, both of the wor≈øhipful, and other of the poorer ≈øort, as we

Tu≈øh, they will doe anie thing to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw vs, that they might haue our liuings anie o them all. I knowe what a good liuing is able to do with the be≈øt of vs all. Cartwright ≈øeekes the peace of our Church no otherwi≈øe then his platforme may ≈øtand. And you knowe, my Lord, that there is no biting to the olde ≈ønake. And I doe not ≈øee o my troth, but that Martins abetters may be wor≈øe then him≈øelfe, and doe more mi≈øchiefe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore goe me to all their hou≈øes, ≈øpare mee none of them, knights, gentlemen, and all. For I tru≈øt the high commi≈ø≈øion may go to anie knight, yea, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mans hou≈øe in England. Therfore, my Lords, I woulde wi≈øh, that ≈øome continuall ≈øpie may be in all tho≈øe places which are mo≈øt ≈øu≈øpected. And let him learne to be wi≈øe, to creepe into acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with ≈øome of the preci≈øer ≈øorte, and looke ≈ømoothlie for a time, vntill hee can execute his commi≈ø≈øion.</p>
            <p>Lo yongman, do not you de≈øerue ≈øtripes, for fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhing on the≈øe blood-hounds in this fort?
